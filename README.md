# Building a Dog Breed Detector Bot on Facebook Workplace, with Keras
![](/images/workplace-bot-example.jpg)

This repo contains all the code for building a Image Classifier using Keras.

A blog post (comming soon) will go over how to train a model to classifiy images of dogs by breed. [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/nexmo-community/DogBreedDectector/blob/master/notebooks/Dog_Breed_Dectector.ipynb)

We'll then take this trained model, deploy on Google App Engine, using Flask to serve our models. [code](https://github.com/nexmo-community/DogBreedDectector/tree/master/Server)

Finally, we'll build a Workplace Bot that will allow users to ask the bot what breed is in the photo. [code](https://github.com/nexmo-community/DogBreedDectector/tree/master/Dog-breed-detector-bot)
